          <p>Lemons: <br><br>

            Description: Lemons are citrus fruits with bright yellow skins and a sour, tangy flavor. They belong to the Rutaceae family and are prized for their culinary versatility and high vitamin C content. Lemon trees are evergreen, with glossy green leaves and fragrant white blossoms that precede the fruit.<br><br>
            Benefits: Lemons are packed with vitamin C, antioxidants, and beneficial plant compounds like flavonoids, which have been linked to various health benefits. They are commonly used in cooking, baking, beverages, and household cleaning due to their refreshing flavor and natural acidity.<br><br>
            Steps:
            Climate: Lemon trees thrive in warm, subtropical climates with mild winters and hot summers. They require full sun exposure to produce abundant fruit.<br><br>
            Soil: Plant lemon trees in well-draining soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5. Sandy loam or loamy soil enriched with organic matter is ideal for promoting healthy root development.<br><br>
            Planting: Choose a suitable location in your garden or select a large container for growing lemons indoors or on a patio. Plant lemon trees in the spring or fall, ensuring the graft union remains above the soil level.</p>

        <div class="grid-box">
          <p>
            Watering: Water young lemon trees regularly to keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Once established, water deeply but infrequently, allowing the soil to dry out slightly between waterings.<br><br>
            Fertilizing: Feed lemon trees with a balanced citrus fertilizer formulated for acid-loving plants. Apply fertilizer in late winter, spring, and summer to provide essential nutrients for healthy growth and fruit production.<br><br>
            Pruning: Prune lemon trees annually to remove dead, damaged, or crossing branches and promote airflow and sunlight penetration. Pruning also helps maintain the tree's shape and size.
            Pest and Disease Management: Monitor lemon trees for pests like aphids, scale insects, and citrus leaf miners. Use organic or chemical controls as needed to manage pest infestations. Additionally, watch for diseases such as citrus greening, root rot, and fungal infections, and take preventive measures to protect the trees.<br><br>
            Harvesting: Depending on the variety, lemons typically take 6-9 months to ripen on the tree. Harvest ripe lemons by cutting or twisting them from the branch. Store harvested lemons at room temperature or refrigerate them for longer shelf life. </p>
