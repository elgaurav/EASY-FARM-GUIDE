          <p>Lavender:
            <br><br>
            Description: Lavender is a fragrant perennial herb that belongs to the mint family, Lamiaceae. It is prized for its aromatic foliage and beautiful spikes of flowers, which range in color from pale purple to deep violet-blue. Lavender is native to the Mediterranean region but is cultivated worldwide for its ornamental, culinary, and medicinal uses.
            <br><br>
            Benefits: Lavender has a long history of use in aromatherapy, herbal medicine, and culinary applications. Its essential oil is renowned for its calming and soothing properties, making it popular for promoting relaxation, reducing stress, and improving sleep quality. Lavender flowers are also used in cooking, baking, and crafting, adding a delicate floral flavor and fragrance to various dishes and products.
            <br><br>
            Steps:
            <br>
            Site Selection: Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil for planting lavender. Lavender plants thrive in full sun and require excellent drainage to prevent root rot.
            <br><br>
            Soil Preparation: Prepare the planting area by loosening the soil to a depth of 8-12 inches and incorporating organic matter such as compost or aged manure to improve soil texture and fertility. Lavender prefers slightly alkaline soil with a pH level between 6.5 and 7.5.
            <br><br>
            Planting: Plant lavender seedlings or nursery-grown plants in the spring or fall, spacing them 12-18 inches apart to allow for air circulation and future growth. Dig a hole slightly larger than the root ball and place the plant in the center, backfilling with soil and watering thoroughly.<br><br>
            Watering: Water newly planted lavender plants regularly to establish a strong root system. Once established, lavender is drought-tolerant and prefers to be on the dry side, so water sparingly, allowing the soil to dry out between waterings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-box">
          <p>Mulching: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of gravel or coarse sand around the base of the lavender plants to suppress weeds, conserve moisture, and reflect sunlight. Avoid organic mulches, as they can trap moisture and promote root rot.
            <br><br>
            Fertilizing: Lavender is a low-maintenance plant that does not require much fertilizer. However, you can apply a balanced, slow-release fertilizer in the spring to promote healthy growth and flowering.
            <br><br>
            Pruning: Prune lavender plants lightly after flowering to remove spent flower spikes and encourage bushy growth. Avoid cutting into old wood, as lavender plants do not produce new growth from woody stems.
            <br><br>
            Pest and Disease Management: Lavender is relatively pest and disease-resistant, but it can be susceptible to issues like root rot, aphids, and spider mites in poorly drained soil or humid conditions. Monitor plants regularly and take preventive measures such as improving drainage and practicing good garden hygiene.
            <br><br>
            Propagation: Propagate lavender plants by taking softwood or semi-hardwood stem cuttings in the spring or early summer. Dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant it in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the cutting consistently moist and provide bottom heat to encourage root development.
            <br><br>
            Harvesting: Harvest lavender flowers in the morning when they are fully open and fragrant. Cut flower spikes with sharp, clean pruners, leaving a few inches of stem attached. Use fresh or dried lavender flowers in sachets, potpourri, herbal teas, culinary dishes, and DIY beauty products.</p>
