            Description: Hibiscus plants belong to the Malvaceae family and are known for their large, showy flowers in shades of red, pink, yellow, white, and orange. They are native to warm, tropical regions but can also be grown as annuals or container plants in temperate climates. Hibiscus flowers have a distinctive trumpet shape and are often used in landscaping, hedges, and as potted specimens.
            <br><br>
            Benefits: Hibiscus flowers are not only ornamental but also have medicinal and culinary uses. Hibiscus tea, made from the dried calyxes of the flowers, is popular for its refreshing taste and potential health benefits, including lowering blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and inflammation.<br><br>
            Steps:
            <br>
            Site Selection: Choose a sunny location with well-drained soil for planting hibiscus. Hibiscus plants thrive in full sun but can tolerate partial shade, especially in hot climates.
            <br><br>
            Soil Preparation: Prepare the planting area by amending the soil with organic matter such as compost or peat moss to improve soil fertility, texture, and drainage.
            <br><br>
            Planting: Plant hibiscus seedlings or container-grown plants in the spring after the danger of frost has passed. Dig a hole twice as wide and deep as the root ball and place the plant in the center, backfilling with soil and watering thoroughly.<br><br>
            Mulching: Apply a 2-3 inch layer of organic mulch, such as shredded bark or straw, around the base of the hibiscus plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grid-box">
          <p>Fertilizing: Feed hibiscus plants with a balanced fertilizer formulated for flowering plants every 4-6 weeks during the growing season to promote healthy growth and abundant flowering.<br><br>

            Pruning: Prune hibiscus plants regularly to remove dead, damaged, or overgrown branches and promote bushy growth and abundant flowering. Pruning can be done throughout the growing season as needed, but major pruning is best done in late winter or early spring before new growth begins.
            <br><br>
            Pest and Disease Management: Monitor hibiscus plants for common pests such as aphids, whiteflies, and scale insects, as well as diseases like powdery mildew, leaf spot, and root rot. Use cultural practices, such as proper watering and good air circulation, to prevent pest and disease problems. Additionally, treat infestations or infections promptly with organic remedies or chemical controls as needed.
            <br><br>
            Winter Care: In colder climates, protect hibiscus plants from frost damage by bringing potted specimens indoors or covering outdoor plants with frost blankets or other protective coverings. Reduce watering and fertilizing in late fall to prepare the plants for dormancy.
            <br><br>
            Propagation: Propagate hibiscus plants by taking softwood stem cuttings in spring or summer. Dip the cut end of the stem in rooting hormone and plant it in a well-draining potting mix. Keep the cutting consistently moist and provide bottom heat to encourage root development.
            <br><br>
            Harvesting: While hibiscus plants are primarily grown for their ornamental appeal, you can harvest the flowers to make hibiscus tea. Harvest flowers in the morning when they are fully open, and remove the petals and sepals before drying them for tea-making.</p>
